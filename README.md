# Technology-Design-and-Mentorship

This project is a design thinking and creative solution project that targetted finding a distraction faced by students at the University of Ghana and creating a solution for the problem. I created a job portal for internships and job applications for students on campus as well as how students could track the status of their applications. This was developed using figma and the project significantly improved my UI/UX design skills.
